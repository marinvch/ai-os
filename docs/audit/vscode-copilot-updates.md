## VS Code v1.99 — March 2025

### 🤖 Agent Mode — General Availability

- **Agent mode reaches VS Code Stable** (`chat.agent.enabled`)
- Three unified chat modes in one view: **Ask**, **Edit**, **Agent**
- Switch modes mid-conversation without losing context

## VS Code v1.100 — April 2025

### 📋 Instruction Files & Prompt Files

- **`.instructions.md` files** with `applyTo:` front matter — auto-attached to matching files
  - Example: `applyTo: "**/*.test.ts"` → attaches test conventions automatically
- **`.prompt.md` files** with `mode:` and `tools:` front matter
  - Can define mode (Ask/Edit/Agent) and available tools
- Both types discoverable via `Chat: Use Prompt` command

## VS Code v1.101 — May 2025

### 🧰 Chat Tool Sets

- Define **tool sets** — named groups of related tools
  - Example: `{ "gh-news": { "tools": [...], "description": "..." } }`
- Created via `Configure Tool Sets > Create new tool sets file`
- Referenced in chat by `#toolsetname`
- `.toolsets.json` file format

### 🔌 MCP — Full Protocol Support

  - `description:` front matter
  - `tools:` list restriction
  - Custom system instructions
- Example use case: "Planning mode" — read-only, no code edits

### 🤖 Agent Mode Improvements (v1.101)

- **Implicit context** — current file offered as suggested context automatically
- Agent receives hint about cursor position (not file content) in agent mode
- Task diagnostic awareness — agent sees errors from problem matchers
- Terminal cwd awareness — knows current working directory in agent terminal
- Built-in tools now individually enable/disable-able (e.g., disable `editFiles`, `runCommands`)
- Fix task configuration errors with "Fix with GitHub Copilot" action

### 📚 Source Control Integration

- **Copilot Coding Agent integration** in GitHub Pull Requests extension:
  - "Assign to Copilot" from issue/PR view in VS Code

## Summary: Key Themes Relevant to AI OS

1. **Custom Instructions proliferation** — `.instructions.md` with `applyTo:`, `.prompt.md` with mode/tools, custom chat modes (`.chatprompt.md`) — VS Code is rapidly standardizing prompt engineering
2. **MCP is the integration standard** — full protocol support (prompts, resources, sampling, auth, dev mode) — MCP is now the primary extension point for AI tooling
3. **Tool sets** — VS Code now has native grouping of tools, similar to what AI OS does with MCP tool partitioning
4. **Agent prompts as slash commands** — MCP prompts become `/mcp.server.prompt` slash commands
5. **Copilot Cloud Agent** — fully autonomous background coding agent — AI OS context enrichment becomes even more critical for cloud agent quality
6. **BYOK GA** — organizations can bring their own models while keeping AI OS context infrastructure
7. **Custom chat modes** — enables repo-specific agent behaviors via `.chatprompt.md` files — AI OS could generate these
