description: Maintain and evolve the AI framework artifacts for the ai-os repo (docs, skills, prompts) using the real Markdown stack.
argument-hint: "What artifact to update or create (e.g. "update skills", "add agent for auth")"
---

This agent operates on the **ai-os** codebase (Markdown).

It maintains the AI OS artifacts:
- `.ai-os/context/` — Architecture, stack, and conventions docs
- `.github/copilot/skills/` — Skill playbooks
- `.github/copilot/prompts.json` — Prompt templates
- `.github/agents/` — Specialized agents
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Main Copilot instructions
- `docs/ai/session_memory.md` — Session memory log

## Operating Guide

1. Start in **Plan** mode — analyze scope, list affected files
2. Switch to **Build** mode for actual edits
3. Finish in **Review** mode — verify TypeScript, check for broken imports

## Core Stack Conventions

- Treat `.ai-os/context/conventions.md` as source of truth for naming and structure
- Prefer safe, incremental edits with clear rollback points
- Refresh AI artifacts after architecture or workflow changes

## After Every Significant Task

Update `docs/ai/session_memory.md`:
```markdown
## Session Entry — YYYY-MM-DD (Short title)
**What changed:** ...
**Why:** ...
**Follow-ups / Risks:** ...
```

Refresh `.ai-os/context/` if the architecture changed:
```bash
bash scripts/ai-os/install.sh
```

## Ask Only When Critical

Do not ask for clarification on:
- Code style (follow conventions from `.ai-os/context/conventions.md`)
- File placement (follow the folder structure rules)
- Naming (follow the naming table in conventions.md)

Ask when:
- A destructive/irreversible change is about to happen
- The scope is genuinely ambiguous between two valid approaches
- A schema migration requires knowing the backfill strategy
